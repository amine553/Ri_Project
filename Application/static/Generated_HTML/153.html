        <p>COMMUNISTS GETTING TOGETHER ? " DESPISE THE ENEMY STRATEGICALLY, " WROTE MAO TSE-TUNG IN HIS HANDBOOK FOR REVOLUTIONARIES, " BUT TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY TACTICALLY . " LAST WEEK, DRAWING A BEAD ON HIS ENEMY IN THE KREMLIN, MAO DID BOTH . HE MADE HIS TACTICAL POINT BY ACCEPTING MOSCOW'S CALL FOR BILATERIAL NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE SINO-SOVIET RIFT AND INVITING NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV TO PEKING . " THE COMMUNIST MOVEMENT HAS REACHED A CRITICAL JUNCTURE . THE TIME HAS COME WHEN DIFFERENCES HAVE TO BE SETTLED, " DECLARED THE RED CHINESE, PROPOSING THAT RUSSIA'S PREMIER STOP OFF IN PEKING ON THE WAY TO CAMBODIA, WHERE A STATE VISIT BY KHRUSHCHEV HAS BEEN DISCUSSED FOR SOME TIME . ALTERNATIVELY, SUGGESTED MAO, A RED CHINESE DELEGATION COULD GO TO MOSCOW TO DISCUSS THE SQUABBLE . BUT THE HAUGHTY, PATRONIZING TONE OF THE MESSAGE, OFFERING TO MEET THE SOVIETS ONLY " ON THE BASIS OF FULL EQUALITY, " AND REPEATING THE OLD DEMANDS FOR A ONE-WAY COMPROMISE, WOULD MAKE IT TOUGH FOR RUSSIA TO ACCEPT . EVEN IN THE EVENT OF A MEETING, SAID ONE HONG KONG EXPERT, " WE CAN EXPECT LITTLE BUT A VERBAL AGREEMENT WHICH WILL SOON BREAK DOWN . / </p>
