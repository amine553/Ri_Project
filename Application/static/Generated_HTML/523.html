        <p>JAPAN VOTE OF CONFIDENCE FOR IKEDA JAPAN'S NEW ELECTION REGULATIONS SEVERELY LIMIT CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES, BUT THE COUNTRY'S POLITICIANS ARE MASTERS AT CIRCUMVENTING THE RULES . FACED WITH A $7,000 LIMIT ON CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURES, MANY A CANDIDATE IN LAST WEEK'S GENERAL ELECTIONS SIMPLY FOLLOWED AN OLD PRACTICE OF HAVING CONTRIBUTIONS FUNNELED THROUGH " RESEARCH INSTITUTES . " SINCE CANDIDATES WERE RESTRICTED TO THREE POSTERS EACH (V . THE PREVIOUS LIMIT OF 12,000), MANY " ACCIDENTALLY " DROPPED CARDS, COMPLETE WITH PICTURE AND SLOGAN, IN TELEPHONE BOOTHS, DEPARTMENT STORES, BARS AND BUSES . ON RAINY DAYS, ONE ASPIRANT EVEN HAD HIS CAMPAIGN WORKERS APPROACH COMMUTERS AND HAND OUT ARMLOADS OF UMBRELLAS ; WHEN THEY WERE OPENED, THE CANDIDATE'S NAME SPREAD OUT IN HUGE CHARACTERS PAINTED ON THE UMBRELLA SURFACE . FOR ALL THE UPROAR OVER PROCEDURES, THE ELECTION AMOUNTED TO AN IMPORTANT VOTE OF CONFIDENCE FOR PRO-CAPITALIST PRO-WESTERN PREMIER HAYATO IKEDA, 63 . THE SOCIALIST OPPOSITION ZEROED IN ON THE NAGGING INFLATION THAT HAS ACCOMPANIED JAPAN'S PHENOMENAL ECONOMIC BOOM . ECONOMIST IKEDA, WHISTLE-STOPPING ACROSS THE NATION, RETORTED THAT INCOMES HAVE RISEN 52 PER CENT IN THE PAST THREE YEARS, WHILE PRICES HAVE RISEN ONLY 14 PER CENT . AT A KYOTO RALLY, HE ASKED : " WHICH DO YOU THINK IS BETTER ? THE SOCIALISTS' ADVOCACY OF DIVIDING THREE EGGS AMONG FOUR PEOPLE ? OR IKEDA'S POLICY OF DIVIDING EIGHT EGGS AMONG FOUR PEOPLE ? " ON ELECTION DAY, AMID THE SHRIEK OF SIRENS THAT REMINDED PEOPLE TO VOTE, IKEDA'S LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC PARTY WON CONTROL OF THE 467-SEAT HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT'S 283-SEAT TOTAL FELL THREE SHORT OF ITS SHARE IN THE OLD HOUSE . THE SOCIALISTS GAINED SEVEN SEATS FOR A TOTAL OF 144 . THE MORE MODERATE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS PICKED UP NINE ADDITIONAL SEATS, FOR A TOTAL OF 23 . </p>
