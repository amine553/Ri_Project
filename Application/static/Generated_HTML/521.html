        <p>COMMUNISTS NIKITA & THE OTHER CHEEK AS PEKING'S PEOPLE'S CONGRESS MET IN SECRET TO HEAR THE LATEST WORD ON THE STATUS OF THE SINO-SOVIET FEUD, AMONG OTHER TOPICS, COMMUNIST CHINA CUT LOOSE WITH ONE OF ITS MOST SCATHING PERSONAL ATTACKS TO DATE ON NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV . IN SIMULTANEOUS ARTICLES, RED FLAG AND PEOPLE'S DAILY ACCUSED HIM OF PARALYZING THE RUSSIAN ARMED FORCES, OF KOWTOWING TO THE CAPITALISTS AND OF SOUNDING TOO HOLY BY FAR . " IT IS CLEAR, " SAID THE CHINESE, THAT " IN SPITE OF KHRUSHCHEV'S BIBLE-READING AND PSALMSINGING, US  IMPERIALISTS HAVE NOT BECOME BEAUTIFUL ANGELS . THEY HAVE NOT TURNED INTO COMPASSIONATE BUDDHAS IN SPITE OF HIS PRAYERS AND INCENSEBURNING . / IN SHORT, SAID RED CHINA, KHRUSHCHEV IS " A LAUGHING STOCK . " THE BLAST MAY WELL OPEN A NEW RIFT BETWEEN MOSCOW AND PEKING, EVEN THOUGH THE KREMLIN HAS BEEN RELATIVELY RESTRAINED IN RECENT WEEKS . FOR AS KHRUSHCHEV ONCE ASSERTED : " THERE IS MUCH IN CHRIST THAT IS COMMON WITH US COMMUNISTS . BUT I CANNOT AGREE WITH HIM WHEN HE SAYS THAT WHEN YOU ARE HIT ON THE RIGHT CHEEK, TURN THE LEFT CHEEK . IF I AM HIT ON THE LEFT CHEEK, I HIT BACK ON THE RIGHT CHEEK SO HARD THAT HIS HEAD MIGHT FALL OFF . / </p>
