        <p>WEST GERMANY TANKS, BUT NO TANKS AMONG THE MANY HIGH-SOUNDING BUT VAGUE PROVISIONS SPRINKLED THROUGH THE FRANCO-GERMAN RECONCILIATION TREATY CEREMONIALLY SIGNED IN PARIS SIX WEEKS AGO WAS ONE CALLING FOR JOINT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS . THIS SEEMED A PROMISING CLAUSE, FOR EXPERTS FROM BOTH NATIONS ALREADY HAD SPENT YEARS WORKING TOGETHER ON VARIOUS PROJECTS EG, ANTITANK ROCKETS DEVELOPED AT THE FRENCH BALLISTIC PROVING GROUNDS AT ST LOUIS, A BIG MILITARY TRANSPORT PLANE DESIGNED TO OPERATE OFF SHORT RUNWAYS, A FRENCH-DESIGNED HEAVY HELICOPTER . BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT JOINT PROJECT IN THE WORKS WAS THE EUROPA PANZER, A MEDIUM TANK ; WHEN FIRST CONCEIVED, THE IDEA WAS THAT IT WOULD REPLACE THE WEST GERMAN BUNDESWEHR'S 2,000 OUT-OF-DATE US  M-47S AND M-48S, GIVE THE FRENCH ARMY A FAST, QUICK-FIRING, MANEUVERABLE WEAPON . BUT THERE WERE SNAGS IN THE EUROPA PANZER SCHEME . THE GERMANS, SOLD ON THE IDEA OF A SAFER, CHEAPER MULTIFUEL ENGINE, WHICH WORKS BEST ON DIESEL OIL, SNIFFED AT THE FRENCH MOTOR DESIGN . AND BONN DEFENSE CHIEFS PREFERRED A FAST-FIRING BRITISH 105-MM . CANNON THAT DID NOT FIT THE CHASSIS THE FRENCH WERE TALKING ABOUT . LAST WEEK BONN'S NEW DEFENSE MINISTER KAI-UWE VON HASSEL OFFICIALLY SCRAPPED THE EUROPA PANZER IDEA, DECLARED THAT WEST GERMANY WOULD PRODUCE A FLASHY NEW TANK OF ITS OWN . FRENCH DEFENSE OFFICIALS HAD GOTTEN WORD OF THE DECISION LONG BEFORE THEIR CHARLES DE GAULLE HAD SIGNED HIS NEW PACT WITH BONN . BUT THE CANCELED DEAL WAS BOUND TO SET MINDS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RHINE WONDERING JUST HOW USEFUL THEIR TREATY REALLY WAS . </p>
