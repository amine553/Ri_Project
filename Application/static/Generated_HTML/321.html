        <p>AFRICA THIRD LARGEST ALTHOUGH AFRICA IS FULL OF TALK ABOUT MERGERS AND FEDERATIONS OF NEW NATIONS, OFTEN THE UNITY SCHEMES ARE NO MORE FIRM THAN MAPS DRAWN IN THE SAND . BUT IN KENYA LAST WEEK, A SERIOUS, SENSIBLE AND LONG-CONSIDERED PLAN TOOK SHAPE . IN NAIROBI, NEWLY ELECTED PRIME MINISTER JOMO KENYATTA PRESIDED OVER A MEETING OF HIS NEIGHBORS . ON ONE SIDE SAT UGANDA'S PRIME MINISTER MILTON APOLLO OBOTE, GRINNING CHEERFULLY BENEATH HIS TOOTHBRUSH MUSTACHE ; ON THE OTHER, TANGANYIKA'S HIGH-SPRIRITED PRESIDENT JULIUS NYERERE . PRESENT AS AN OBSERVER : SOMALIA'S FOREIGN MINISTER ABDULLAHI ISSA . FROM THREE HOURS OF TALK EMERGED THE DECISION TO WORK FOR A FEDERATION OF KENYA, UGANDA, TANGANYIKA AND ZANZIBAR, WITH SOMALIA, RWANDA AND BURUNDI ALSO INVITED . " WE HAVE A COMMON HISTORY, CULTURE AND CUSTOMS WHICH MAKE OUR UNITY BOTH LOGICAL AND NATURAL, " DECLARED KENYATTA, THEREBY SEEMING TO REFUTE OLD CHARGES THAT HE WAS PAROCHIALLY INTERESTED ONLY IN PUSHING THE FORTUNES OF HIS KIKUYU TRIBE, THE MOST NUMEROUS IN KENYA . " WE REJECT TRIBALISM, RACIALISM OR INWARD-LOOKING POLICIES . " THE EAST AFRICAN FEDERATION, WHICH MAY BE LAUNCHED WHEN KENYA GAINS FULL INDEPENDENCE, PROBABLY LATER THIS YEAR, COULD EVENTUALLY BECOME A NATION OF 25 MILLION PEOPLE, THE THIRD LARGEST IN AFRICA . THERE IS NO CLEAR NOTION YET AS TO WHO WILL RUN THE FEDERATION OR HOW TIGHT IT WILL BE, BUT A JOINT COMMITTEE WILL SPEND THE NEXT TWO MONTHS DRAFTING A PROGRAM FOR JOINT ECONOMIC PLANNING, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMON DEFENSE, FOREIGN AND DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATION, AND A CENTRAL BANK . FEDERATION, SAID THE THREE LEADERS, WILL CREATE " A FORMIDABLE FORCE AND A VAST MARKET . " AMONG MANY CRITICAL PROBLEMS FACING THE PROPOSED FEDERATION ARE KENYA'S OCCASIONALLY BLOODY DISPUTE WITH SOMALIA, PROBABLE OPPOSITION FROM BUGANDA'S FREDERICK MUTESA II ( / KING FREDDIE " ), AND RESISTANCE FROM KENYA'S 55,000 REMAINING EUROPEAN SETTLERS, WHO MAY BE APPREHENSIVE OF SUBMERSION IN EVEN MORE MILLIONS OF AFRICANS . BUT THE FEDERATION SCHEME WAS OFF TO A REMARKABLY RESOLUTE START . WHEN A NEWSMAN IN NAIROBI COMPLIMENTED PRESIDENT NYERERE ON HOW QUICKLY THE PLAN HAD BEEN LAUNCHED, NYERERE SMILED BROADLY . " WHAT DO YOU MEAN, QUICK ? " SAID HE . " THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT FOR 40 YEARS . / </p>
