        <p>KASHMIR AS PRICKLY AS CACTUS AS THE THIRD ROUND OF THE KASHMIR TALKS BEGAN IN KARACHI LAST WEEK, A CACTUS PLANT WAS PROMINENTLY PLACED ON THE NEGOTIATING TABLE IN FRONT OF INDIA'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR SARDAR SWARAN SINGH AN APT SYMBOL OF JUST HOW PRICKLY THE DISPUTE BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN STILL REMAINS . YET BY THE END OF THE DAY, THE FIRST FAINT GLIMMER OF COMPROMISE WAS VISIBLE . IN A SHARP DEPARTURE FROM ITS PREVIOUS INFLEXIBLE STAND, INDIA INDICATED THAT IT WOULD BE WILLING TO PARTITION KASHMIR ALONG A BOUNDARY OTHER THAN THE CURRENT UN  CEASE-FIRE LINE, WHICH NOW GIVES INDIA TWO-THIRDS OF THE PROVINCE, INCLUDING ALL OF THE RICH VALE OF KASHMIR . THE NEW INDIAN PROPOSAL CALLED FOR INDIA TO KEEP LADAKH, PART OF WHICH IS CURRENTLY OCCUPIED BY RED CHINA, MOST OF THE PREDOMINANTLY HINDU AREA OF JAMMU, AND ONE-HALF OF THE VALE, INCLUDING THE PROVINCE'S CAPITAL OF SRINIGAR . PAKISTAN WOULD GET THE REST OF THE PROVINCE, PLUS RIGHTS OF FREE ACCESS FOR ALL ITS CITIZENS TO THE INDIAN PARTS OF THE PROVINCE . THOUGH PAKISTAN STILL SAYS IT WANTS ALL OF KASHMIR, IT HAS SIDETRACKED ITS DEMAND FOR A PLEBISCITE OVER THE WHOLE AREA, WHICH IS 77 PER CENT MOSLEM . THE PROSPECT IS FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS IN APRIL THIS TIME IN NEW DELHI . </p>
