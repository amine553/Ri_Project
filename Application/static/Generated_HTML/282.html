        <p>IRAN NO LONGER FOR THE CORRUPT " CORRUPTION IS THE LUBRICANT OF THE IRANIAN ECONOMY, " A DIPLOMAT IN TEHERAN ONCE OBSERVED . DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE PISHKASH (BRIBE), JUSTICE WAS BOUGHT AND SOLD, TAX RIGHTS WERE PURCHASED, GOVERNMENT JOBS AUCTIONED OFF, CONTRACTS GIVEN, AND CONSCRIPTION WAS WAIVED . SPORADIC EFFORTS BY SHAH MOHAMMED REZA PAHLEVI TO CLEAN THINGS UP USUALLY ENDED DISMALLY IN A DISASTROUS SERIES OF ACQUITTALS, AND CASES DROPPED FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE . BUT TEN MONTHS AGO, NEW PREMIER ASSADOLLAH ALAM PLEDGED TO UNDERTAKE " AN ANTICORRUPTION CAMPAIGN WITH GREAT DILIGENCE AND ALL SEVERITY . " THOUGH THE CYNICAL SNICKERED, ALAM GOT FREE REIN FROM THE SHAH, CAREFULLY BEGAN BUILDING AIRTIGHT CASES AGAINST SUSPECTED GRAFTERS AMONG IRAN'S LEADING BUREAUCRATS AND GOVERNMENT LEADERS . HIS FIRST MAJOR TARGET WAS GENERAL MOHAMMED ALI KHAZAI, THE IRANIAN ARMY'S CHIEF OF ORDNANCE, WHO HAD PARLAYED HIS $6,000 SALARY INTO THREE HOUSES IN THE SUBURBS OF TEHERAN, FOUR APARTMENT HOUSES IN FRANCE, FIVE AUTOMOBILES, $100,000 IN EUROPEAN BANKS AND $200,000 IN CASH . A MILITARY COURT CONVICTED KHAZAI OF TAKING A CUT OUT OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND SENTENCED HIM TO FIVE YEARS OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT . LAST WEEK ALAM'S ANTICORRUPTION DRIVE WAS IN FULL SWING . IN TEHERAN, A MILITARY TRIBUNAL SENTENCED GENERAL ABDULLAH HEDAYAT, IRAN'S FIRST FOUR-STAR GENERAL AND ONCE A CLOSE ADVISER OF THE SHAH, TO TWO YEARS IN PRISON FOR EMBEZZLING MONEY ON MILITARY HOUSING CONTRACTS, BRUSHED ASIDE HIS PLEA FOR APPEAL WITH THE BRUSQUE EXPLANATION THAT " MORE CHARGES ARE PENDING " THE FORMER BOSS OF THE TEHERAN ELECTRICITY BOARD WAS IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR FIVE YEARS ; CASES WERE IN PREPARATION AGAINST AN EX-WAR MINISTER AND TWELVE OTHER GENERALS FOR GRAFT . SAID ONE OBSERVER : " THE SHAH HAS GOT THE GRAFTERS AND SPECULATORS ON THE RUN . / </p>
