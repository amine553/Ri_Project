        <p>COMMON MARKET BACK TO WORK WHEN CHARLES DE GAULLE SHOCKED EUROPE WITH HIS HIGHHANDED EXCLUSION OF BRITAIN FROM THE COMMON MARKET LAST JANUARY, MANY EUROPEAN OFFICIALS SPECULATED THAT THE GENERAL'S ACTION MIGHT PERMANENTLY DISRUPT THE COMMON MARKET'S PROGRESS . INDEED, FOR TWO MONTHS, MEETING AFTER MEETING AT BRUSSELS ENDED IN RECRIMINATION AND DEADLOCK . BUT FINALLY LAST WEEK THE REST OF THE SIX SWALLOWED THEIR RESENTMENT AT FRANCE AND GOT BACK TO BUSINESS AS BEFORE . TWO AND A HALF YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, THE COMMON MARKET NATIONS VOTED ANOTHER 10 PER CENT SLASH IN EACH NATION'S CUSTOMS DUTIES ON INDUSTRIAL IMPORTS FROM OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, AND AGREED TO CUT BY 20 PER CENT THE AVERAGE TARIFF ON A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL GOODS IMPORTED FROM OUTSIDE THE COMMON MARKET . THE LATEST REDUCTION WAS PLAINLY INTENDED AS A GOODWILL GESTURE ON THE EVE OF TARIFF-CUTTING NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE US  IN GENEVA NEXT MONTH . HOWEVER, WHAT THE US  IS PRIMARILY ANXIOUS TO SECURE AT GENEVA ITS EUROPEAN MARKET FOR AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS WILL NOT BE UP FOR NEGOTIATION, SINCE THE COMMON MARKET NATIONS LAST WEEK WERE UNABLE TO AGREE ON THEIR OWN PRICE LEVELS </p>
