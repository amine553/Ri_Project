        <p>YUGOSLAVIA HOW TO WIN JOB SECURITY LIKE MANY DURABLE DICTATORS, YUGOSLAVIA'S MARSHAL TITO PRESERVES HIS ONE-MAN RULE BY THE SIMPLE EXPEDIENT OF HOLDING DOWN THE KEY JOBS HIMSELF . HE IS SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY, SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND CHIEF OF STATE . AS IF THAT WERE NOT ENOUGH, BELGRADE'S COMPLAISANT FEDERAL PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED A NEW NATIONAL CONSTITUTION LAST WEEK GIVING TITO THE PRESIDENCY FOR LIFE.* WHILE HIS HANDSOME WIFE JOVANKA BEAMED DOWN FROM A VISITORS' BOX, TITO STRODE INTO THE HALL TO THE CHEERS OF THE CROWD AND SAT GRAVELY THROUGH A FORMAL READING OF THE NEW CHARTER . AFTERWARD, LOOKING REMARKABLY FIT FOR A MAN WHO WILL BE 71 NEXT MONTH, HE HAPPILY AUTOGRAPHED COPIES OF THE CONSTITUTION . IN ADDITION TO SANCTIFYING TITO'S SUPREMACY, THE DOCUMENT INCLUDED OTHER NOVELTIES . A NEW ASSEMBLY WILL BE COMPOSED OF NO FEWER THAN FIVE CHAMBERS, EACH WITH ITS OWN SPECIALTY . ONE WILL DEAL WITH ECONOMICS, OTHERS WITH EDUCATION, SOCIAL, GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE, AND FEDERAL MATTERS . FOR THE FIRST TIME, THERE WILL BE A PREMIER AND A VICE PRESIDENT, ALTHOUGH NEITHER ONE IS DESIGNATED TO SUCCEED TITO IN THE EVENT OF HIS SUDDEN DEATH . THEIR POWERS WILL BE STRICTLY LIMITED . UNDER THE NEW CONSTITUTION, THE COMMUNIST PARTY REMAINS THE " FUNDAMENTAL INITIATOR OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY . " SPAIN'S FRANCISCO FRANCO IS THE ONLY OTHER DICTATOR WITH LEGAL LIFE TENURE AS CHIEF OF STATE . GHANA'S STRONGMAN PRESIDENT, KWAME NKRUMAH, WAS VOTED PERMANENTLY INTO OFFICE IN SEPTEMBER, BUT HIS HIGH DEDICATION MODESTLY VETOED THE GESTURE, PREFERRING TO RELY ON ELECTIONS A SAFE ENOUGH GESTURE SINCE THE COUNTRY IS OFFICIALLY A ONE-PARTY STATE . </p>
