        <p>UNITED NATIONS ANGER IN THE COUNCIL ADLAI STEVENSON HAD NOT BEEN SO ANGRY IN THE UN  SINCE LAST YEAR'S CUBAN CRISIS . " THIS REPREHENSIBLE ACT OF MURDER, " HE SAID BEFORE THE SECURITY COUNCIL, " DESERVES THE STRONGEST CONDEMNATION . OUTRAGES OF THIS KIND CANNOT PASS WITHOUT THE STERN DISAPPROVAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY . / STEVENSON WAS REFERRING TO A BLOODY FLARE-UP ON THE ISRAELI-SYRIAN FRONTIER TOUCHED OFF, ISRAEL CHARGED, WHEN TEN SYRIAN SOLDIERS SNEAKED ACROSS THE JORDAN RIVER AND THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE AND MACHINE-GUNNED TWO 19-YEAR-OLD FARMERS IRRIGATING A KIBBUTZ FIELD NORTH OF THE SEA OF GALILEE . THE SYRIANS DENIED THE KILLINGS, ACCUSED ISRAEL OF SENDING 15 ARMORED CARS CHARGING ACROSS THE BORDER . LAST WEEK, WITH BOTH COUNTRIES HAVING BROUGHT COMPLAINTS TO AN EMERGENCY SESSION OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL (ITS 202ND SESSION ON A PALESTINE-RELATED ISSUE), THE UN'S TRUCE CHIEF ON THE SCENE, NORWEGIAN LIEUT . GENERAL ODD BULL, LEFT LITTLE DOUBT THAT SYRIA HAD BEEN THE AGGRESSOR . BACKED UP BY PHOTOGRAPHS, SPENT BULLETS AND DIAGRAMS, BULL'S REPORT TOLD OF FINDING " TWO DEAD BODIES RIDDLED WITH HOLES ; A TRACTOR WITH NUMEROUS BULLET HOLES ; A MAGAZINE FROM AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON ; A LEVER HANDLE FROM A GRENADE ; . . . A POOL OF BLOOD WHERE ONE MAN ALLEGEDLY HAD BEEN SHOT, LEAVING PART OF HIS BRAIN ; TRACKS LEADING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE JORDAN RIVER TO THE AMBUSH POSITION AND THE TRACKS RETURNING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE JORDAN RIVER . " IN THE PAST, ISRAEL HAS USUALLY MADE ROUTINE COMPLAINTS TO THE UN  WHEN THERE WERE TRUCE BREACHES ON THE BRISTLING BORDER, THEN STAGED HEAVILY RETALIATORY RAIDS OF ITS OWN . WHEN SUCH INCIDENTS CAME BEFORE THE SECURITY COUNCIL, THE US  USUALLY STAYED NEUTRAL . THIS TIME ISRAEL HAD FOLLOWED US  ADVICE AND APPEALED FOR SECURITY COUNCIL ACTION HENCE THE US  POLICY SWITCH TO SUPPORT ISRAEL . AT WEEK'S END THE US  AND GREAT BRITAIN INTRODUCED A JOINT RESOLUTION THAT CONDEMNED " THE WANTON MURDER " AND CALLED " THE ATTENTION OF THE SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC " TO THE ASSEMBLED EVIDENCE . THE RUSSIANS, WHO IN THE PAST HAVE USUALLY THREATENED TO USE THEIR VETO IN SUPPORT OF THE ARABS, BACKED MOROCCAN AMENDMENTS WATERING DOWN THE US-BRITISH RESOLUTION ; THE MOROCCAN VERSION AVOIDED CONDEMNATION OF SYRIA AND MERELY REGISTERED " REGRETS FOR THE DEATH OF TWO PERSONS . / </p>
