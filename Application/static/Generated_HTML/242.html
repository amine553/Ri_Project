        <p>KASHMIR TOWARD THE FINAL ROUND FOUR CONFERENCES IN THE PAST FOUR MONTHS HAVE FAILED TO GET INDIA AND PAKISTAN ANY CLOSER TO A SETTLEMENT OF THEIR BITTER DISPUTE OVER CONTROL OF KASHMIR . LAST WEEK IN KARACHI, THE FIFTH ROUND OF TALKS AGAIN ENDED IN STALEMATE AS INDIA ONCE MORE STUBBORNLY REJECTED PAKISTAN'S CLAIM TO THE RICH VALE OF KASHMIR . UNWILLING TO BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR BREAKING OFF THE TALKS, PAKISTAN RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO ANOTHER MEETING LATER THIS MONTH IN NEW DELHI . US  SECRETARY OF STATE DEAN RUSK, DUE IN KARACHI FOR A MEETING OF THE CENTO NATIONS, WOULD BE TAKING TIME OUT TO URGE A KASHMIR SETTLEMENT ON THE PAKISTANIS . LEST HE APPEAR PARTIAL, RUSK WOULD ALSO CARRY HIS APPEAL TO NEW DELHI THIS WEEK, WHERE HE IS DUE TO HOLD TALKS WITH INDIAN PRIME MINISTER NEHRU . BUT TIME WAS RUNNING OUT . SAID CHIEF PAKISTANI NEGOTIATOR ZULFIKAR ALI BHUTTO : " WE HAVE TOLD INDIA THAT THE SIXTH ROUND WILL BE THE FINAL ROUND . / </p>
