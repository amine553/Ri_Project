        <p>THE ROAD TO JAIL IS PAVED WITH NONOBJECTIVE ART SINCE THE KREMLIN'S SHARPEST BARBS THESE DAYS ARE AIMED AT MODERN ART AND " WESTERN ESPIONAGE, " IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE KGB'S COPS WOULD TURN UP A VICTIM WHOSE WRONGDOINGS COMBINED BOTH EVILS . HE TURNED OUT TO BE A LENINGRAD PHYSICS TEACHER WHOSE TASTE FOR ABSTRACT PAINTING ALLEGEDLY LED HIM TO JOIN THE US  SPY SERVICE . POLICE SAID THEY FIRST SPOTTED THE TEACHER, ONE RUDOLF FRIEDMAN, AS HE MUTTERED UNCOMPLIMENTARY REMARKS ABOUT SOCIALIST REALISM WHILE STROLLING THROUGH LENINGRAD'S RUSSIAN MUSEUM . A WELL-DRESSED US  TOURIST APPROACHED HIM, ENTHUSIASTICALLY SHARED HIS SENTIMENTS, AND PROMISED TO SEND FRIEDMAN REPRODUCTIONS OF AVANT-GARDE PAINTINGS FROM AMERICA . THE PICTURE FRIEDMAN LIKED BEST, SAID THE COPS INDIGNANTLY, WAS A " CHAOS OF BLACK, RED AND BLUE SPLOTCHES CAPTIONED I NEED YOU TONIGHT . " SOON, THEY SAID, THE TEACHER WAS GETTING MESSAGES FROM THE US  WRITTEN IN INVISIBLE INK . JUST AS FRIEDMAN PREPARED TO DELIVER INFORMATION " VERY REMOTE FROM THEORETICAL ARGUMENTS ABOUT ABSTRACT ART, " POLICEMOVED IN AND HUSTLED HIM OFF TO JAIL . </p>
