        <p>ISRAEL THE MAN WITHOUT ENEMIES TO THE CEREMONIAL BLARE OF A RAM'S HORN, ISRAEL'S THIRD PRESIDENT WAS SWORN INTO OFFICE LAST WEEK . HE WAS SCHNEOR ZALMAN SHAZAR, 73, A BALDING, BESPECTACLED SCHOLAR OF JEWISH HISTORY . THE COUNTRY'S FIRST MINISTER OF EDUCATION, HE WAS ELECTED BY THE KNESSET TO FILL THE VACANCY CAUSED BY THE DEATH OF IZHAK BEN-ZVI LAST MONTH . RUSSIAN-BORN SHAZAR EMIGRATED TO PALESTINE VIA CENTRAL EUROPE DURING THE '20S,* WAS HAND-PICKED FOR THE JOB BY AN OLD POLITICAL CRONY, PREMIER DAVID BEN-GURION . SHAZAR HAS ANOTHER IMPORTANT QUALIFICATION . AS BEN-GURION PUTS IT, HE IS " A MAN WITHOUT ENEMIES . " NORMALLY SOFT-SPOKEN, SHAZAR IS AN IMPASSIONED, SKILLFUL ORATOR WHEN HE GETS ONTO A SPEAKER'S PLATFORM . DURING LAST MONTH'S COMMEMORATION OF THE WARSAW GHETTO UPRISING, SHAZAR BROUGHT THE AUDIENCE TO TEARS SIMPLY BY REPEATING THE WORD " WARSAW " IN HUSHED TONES BEFORE BEGINNING HIS ADDRESS ; ON ANOTHER OCCASION HE WAS SO CARRIED AWAY BY HIS OWN ORATORY THAT HE FELL OFF THE STAGE AND HAD TO BE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL FOR A BADLY SPRAINED LEG . SHAZAR IS ALSO NOTORIOUSLY ABSENT-MINDED . YEARS AGO IN POLAND, THE STORY GOES, HE BOARDED A TRAIN ONLY TO FIND THAT HE HAD LOST HIS RAIL TICKET . ASSURED BY THE CONDUCTOR THAT HE COULD BUY ANOTHER, SHAZAR REPLIED : " I KNOW, BUT IF I DON'T FIND THE TICKET I WON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING . / SHAZAR'S ORIGINAL SURNAME WAS RUBASHOV, BUT LIKE MANY VETERAN ZIONISTS, HE HEBRAIZED HIS NAME . DAVID GREEN BECAME DAVID BEN-GURION ; ISAAC SHIMSHELEVITZ BECAME IZHAK BEN-ZVI . SCHNEOR ZALMAN RUBASHOV BECAME SHAZAR BY COMBINING THE INITIALS OF HIS FIRST, MIDDLE AND LAST NAMES . AN EXCEPTION TO THE COMMON PRACTICE : ISRAEL'S FIRST PRESIDENT, WHO REMAINED CHAIM WEIZMANN . </p>
