        <p>CAMBODIA     THE SLUMBERING PRINCE     FORMER US  SECRETARY OF STATE DEAN ACHESON IS ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY ESTEEMED AMERICANS IN PNOM PENH . THE REASON DATES BACK TO LAST YEAR, WHEN ACHESON SUCCESSFULLY REPRESENTED CAMBODIA BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE IN THE HAGUE IN A TERRITORIAL DISPUTE WITH THAILAND . LAST WEEK THE US  TRIED TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS FRIENDSHIP IN AN EFFORT TO END ITS ACERBIC AND SOMEWHAT MYSTERIOUS LITTLE QUARREL WITH CAMBODIA'S VAIN, UNPREDICTABLE LEADER, PRINCE NORODOM SIHANOUK . THE US  WAS RUDELY REBUFFED . SENDING ACHESON OUT TO CAMBODIA ON A PEACEMAKING MISSION WOULD BE FINE, DECLARED THE PRINCE, BUT ONLY ON THREE CONDITIONS : 1) THAT WASHINGTON APOLOGIZE FOR THE US  DIPLOMAT WHO DESCRIBED AS " BARBAROUS " RADIO CAMBODIA'S TASTELESS COMMENTS ON JOHN F . KENNEDY'S ASSASSINATION, 2) A FORMAL WITHDRAWAL BY US  DIPLOMATS OF A QUESTION ASKING WHETHER THE " CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT HAD REJOICED OVER KENNEDY'S DEATH, " 3) AND THE CLOSING DOWN OF A RADIO STATION THAT SIHANOUK CLAIMED WAS RUN BY CIA IN LAOS OR THAILAND FOR THE PURPOSE OF SENDING SUBVERSIVE BROADCASTS INTO CAMBODIA . WASHINGTON TERMED SIHANOUK'S CONDITIONS " TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE . " IN FACT, SIHANOUK IS PROBABLY ONLY TAUNTING THE US  OUT OF FEAR OF THE RED CHINESE AND WANTS TO AVOID AN OVERT DIPLOMATIC BREAK . SIHANOUK IS STILL ANXIOUS FOR A GENEVA CONFERENCE TO GUARANTEE CAMBODIAN NEUTRALITY, BUT SUCH A CONFERENCE IS MEANINGLESS WITHOUT US  PARTICIPATION . AS SIHANOUK HIMSELF SAID LAST WEEK AFTER CLOSING CAMBODIA'S EMBASSY IN LONDON, " IT APPEARS NECESSARY, WITHOUT A DIPLOMATIC BREAK, TO PUT OUR RELATIONS IN SLUMBER . / </p>
