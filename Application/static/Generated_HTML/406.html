        <p>POLAND WAY OF THE CROSS AT JASNA GORA MONASTERY, THE MOST SACRED SHRINE IN POLAND, STEFAN CARDINAL WYSZYNSKI LAST WEEK BLASTED GROWING COMMUNIST EFFORTS TO CURTAIL CHURCH ACTIVITIES . SPEAKING TO GROUPS OF THE MORE THAN 100,000 PILGRIMS GATHERED TO CELEBRATE THE FEAST OF THE ASSUMPTION, THE CARDINAL CITED A GOVERNMENT BAN ON ORGANIZED PILGRIMAGES AND PROTESTED AGAINST ROADBLOCKS WHERE SOME PILGRIMS HAD BEEN HARASSED DURING THE TRIP TO THE SHRINE, ENDURING THEIR OWN " WAY OF THE CROSS . " OSTENSIBLY, THE BAN RESULTED FROM A SMALLPOX OUTBREAK IN THE VICINITY, BUT THERE WAS NO INTERFERENCE WITH NONRELIGIOUS TOURISTS . ON ANOTHER FRONT, THE REDS REFUSED TO LET CHILDREN AT STATE-RUN SUMMER CAMPS ATTEND MASS . SAID WYSZYNSKI : " THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROHIBIT EVERYTHING . IF A CITIZEN DOES NOT DEMAND HIS RIGHTS, HE IS NO LONGER A CITIZEN . HE BECOMES A SLAVE . " </p>
