        <p>RUSSIA BACK TO SIBERIA, COMRADES SOVIET SCIENTISTS HAVE NOT YET TAUGHT SHRIMPS TO WHISTLE, BUT RADIO MOSCOW LAST WEEK REPORTED AN EVEN MORE FANTASTIC FEAT . GEOLOGISTS IN NORTHERN SIBERIA, IT RECOUNTED BREATHLESSLY, DUG UP A PAIR OF SALAMANDERS THAT HAD BEEN FROZEN FOR 5,000 YEARS, THAWED THEM OUT AND FED THEM BERRIES AND MOSQUITOES FROM THEIR HANDS . ONE OF THE PREHISTORIC NEWTS (TRITONS) SCAMPERED HAPPILY ABOUT FOR THREE WEEKS BEFORE IT DIED ; IT WAS THEN BOTTLED AND SENT TO A MOSCOW UNIVERSITY LABORATORY . ITS COMRADE LIVED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS IN A MUSEUM . RADIO MOSCOW, WHICH SAID THE TALE OF TWO TRITONS WAS BASED ON AN ACCOUNT IN A SOVIET LITERARY MAGAZINE, EVEN SUGGESTED THAT THE DISCOVERY MIGHT HAVE MOMENTOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR SPACE FLIGHT . IF NEWTS COULD SURVIVE ALL THAT TIME, WHY NOT DEEPFREEZE SOVIET COSMONAUTS AND THUS ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR FOOD DURING THEIR LONG VOYAGES THROUGH THE UNIVERSE ? RADIO MOSCOW'S STORY BLEW UP A STORM OF CABLES AND TELEPHONE CALLS FROM WESTERN NEWSMEN PANTING AFTER ALL THE NEWTY DETAILS . AND, THOUGH US  SCIENTISTS SOON POOH-POOHED THE SALAMANDER SAGA, IT MADE THE FRONT PAGES OF MOST US  NEWSPAPERS, WHICH SINCE SPUTNIK I HAVE TENDED TO OVERPLAY FAR-OUT SOVIET SCIENTIFIC CLAIMS . THEN A RUSSIAN SCIENTIST DEBUNKED THE STORY . PROFESSOR GLEB LOZINO-LOZINSKY, HEAD OF THE SPACE BIOLOGY LABORATORY AT THE LENINGRAD INSTITUTE OF CYTOLOGY, DISCLOSED THAT IT HAD BEEN LIFTED FROM A CHILDREN'S BOOK, AND " HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SCIENCE . " SNAPPED HE : / THE AUTHOR OF THIS TALE SHOULD BE PUNISHED . " FROM RADIO MOSCOW : SIBERIAN SILENCE . </p>
