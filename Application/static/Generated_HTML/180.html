        <p>FRANCE FINIS FOR SAO  ? AS SWISAIR FLIGHT 227 TO ZURICH TAXIED ONTO THE RUNWAY AT MUNICH LAST WEEK, IT WAS FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY A BLACK POLICE LIMOUSINE . NOT UNTIL THE RED-AND-SILVER CONVAIR DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT DID THE PLAINCLOTHESMAN INSIDE THE CAR RETURN TO HEADQUARTERS TO REPORT THAT GEORGES BIDAULT, 63, FORMER PREMIER OF FRANCE AND NOW SELF-STYLED OPERATIONAL CHIEF OF THE TERRORIST SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION, HAD LEFT WEST GERMANY . FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE BIDAULT WAS TRACED TO HIS HIDEAWAY IN A RURAL VILLA LAST MONTH, BAVARIA'S MINISTER OF INTERIOR HEINRICH JUNKER BREATHED EASILY . SIGHED HE : " A HEAVY CROSS IS OFF MY BACK . " BIDAULT DID NOT LEAVE MUNICH WITHOUT A VOW TO " CONTINUE MY FIGHT AGAINST DE GAULLE UNTIL FREEDOM HAS BEEN RESTORED IN MY COUNTRY . " LANDING IN PORTUGAL UNDER AN ASSUMED NAME, HE WAS GIVEN EVEN LESS CHANCE TO PLOT AGAINST DE GAULLE'S LIFE THAN HE ENJOYED IN EASYGOING BAVARIA ; ALMOST AS SOON AS HE TURNED UP AT A LISBON ROOMING HOUSE, SECURITY COPS HAULED HIM OFF TO A SUBURBAN LISBON VILLA . HE WAS EXPECTED TO SEEK REFUGE IN SOUTH AMERICA . DRIFTING AIMLESSLY LIKE A MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY, BIDAULT TODAY IS A PATHETIC FUGITIVE WHO DRINKS TOO MUCH AND TALKS TOO MUCH TO BE AN EFFECTIVE OPPONENT OF THE REGIME . AND FRENCH OFFICIALS INSIST THAT THE SAO  MOVEMENT, WHOSE MURDEROUS FOLLOWERS ONCE STRUCK TERROR INTO THE HEARTS OF FRENCHMEN, HAS FALLEN APART SINCE FRANCE'S TRUCE WITH ALGERIA IN MARCH 1962 . PLAGUED BY APATHY AND HOUNDED BY THE 61,000-MAN POLICE FORCE OF INTERIOR MINISTER ROGER FREY, THE SAO  IS NO LONGER ABLE TO MAINTAIN COMMANDO UNITS IN EACH OF FRANCE'S NINE MILITARY DISTRICTS, AS IT ONCE DID . TODAY, TOP OFFICIALS CLAIM, THERE ARE PROBABLY NO MORE THAN 30 HARDCORE ACTIVISTS LEFT IN THE COUNTRY . WHILE HUNDREDS OF FANATIC ANTI-GAULLISTS HAVE FOUND REFUGE IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES (500 IN SPAIN ALONE), THEY TOO ARE NOW ALMOST ALL UNDER CLOSE POLICE SURVEILLANCE . </p>
