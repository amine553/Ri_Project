        <p>RUSSIA        THE WOLVES LIKE WOLVES IN WINTER, THE CIRCLE OF COMMUNIST CRITICS TIGHTENED AROUND BRASH YOUNG POET EVGENY EVTUSHENKO LAST WEEK . THE KREMLIN ANNOUNCED A FULL MEETING OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE NEXT MONTH TO DISCUSS " IDEOLOGICAL " MATTERS MEANING THE CRACKDOWN ON EVTUSHENKO AND OTHER MAVERICK INTELLECTUALS . THE OFFICIAL ORGAN OF THE MOSCOW WRITERS UNION, LITERATURNAYA ROSSIYA, BACKED A READER'S SUGGESTION THAT EVTUSHENKO BE THROWN OUT OF THE UNION A MOVE THAT WOULD REDUCE THE HIGH-LIVING POET TO POVERTY, SINCE STATE PUBLISHING HOUSES WOULD NO LONGER ACCEPT HIS WORK . EVEN COSMONAUT YURI GAGARIN JOINED THE WOLF PACK SNARLING AT EVTUSHENKO'S HEELS . FOLLOWING UP EARLIER ATTACKS ON THE POET FOR DARING TO EVADE SOVIET CENSORSHIP BY PUBLISHING HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN FRANCE, GAGARIN SAID THE ACT DEMONSTRATED " AN UNFORGIVABLE LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY . / </p>
