        <p>HUNGARY TWISTING FOR MARX IN RUSSIA THE TWIST IS STILL AN UNDERGROUND MOVEMENT, BANNED AS AN EXAMPLE OF CAPITALIST DEGENERACY, BUT MOST OF THE SATELLITES HAVE GIVEN UP FIGHTING THE DANCE . TYPICAL IS HUNGARY, WHICH, TO DISSUADE ITS YOUTH FROM TUNING IN ON WESTERN RADIO STATIONS, ACTUALLY IMPORTED TWIST RECORDS AND COMMISSIONED BUDAPEST'S TOP CAT, JANOS KOOS, TO GROOVE SOME TWIST DISKS OF HIS OWN . NEXT, TESTING THE THEORY THAT DEEP-RHYTHM MUSIC EASES INDUSTRIAL TENSIONS BY SUBLIMATING AGGRESSIONS, EFFICIENCY EXPERTS IN A HUNGARIAN TEXTILE FACTORY GAVE THE WORKERS A 15-MINUTE BREAK, DURING WHICH TWIST MUSIC WAS PIPED THROUGH THE PLANT . BILLHATTED MEN AND SHAWLED WOMEN, MORE ACCUSTOMED TO THE CZARDAS THAN THE TWIST, DID RHYTHMICAL GYMNASTICS ALONGSIDE THEIR MACHINES . RESULT : AFTER THE BREAK, WORKERS MADE 23 PER CENT FEWER MISTAKES ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE . </p>
