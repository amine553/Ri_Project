        <p>THE CONGO VANISHING FRIENDS INTO THE GLASS-ENCLOSED WINTER GARDEN OF HIS PINK PALACE STRODE KATANGA'S SECESSIONIST MOISE TSHOMBE WITH AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT . " I AM PLEASED TO HAVE ENDED MY WORK AND HAVE DONE MY DUTY, " TSHOMBE TOLD NEWSMEN, AND NOW HE WOULD BE LEAVING FOR NORTHERN RHODESIA TO TAKE CARE OF A TROUBLESOME EYE AILMENT . HOW LONG WOULD HE BE GONE ? " THE DOCTORS WILL DECIDE THAT, " SAID TSHOMBE, BUT ELISABETHVILLE HUMMED WITH RUMORS THAT HE WAS GOING FOR GOOD . MOISE DID NOTHING TO SQUELCH THE GOSSIP, FOR 48 HOURS AFTER HE LEFT HIS CAPITAL HE WAS ON A PLANE BOUND FOR PARIS . AT THE RATE TSHOMBE'S FRIENDS WERE DESERTING HIM, SELF-EXILE MIGHT NOT BE SUCH A BAD IDEA . LAST WEEK 23 OF TSHOMBE'S TOP KATANGA GENDARMERIE OFFICERS FLEW INTO LEOPOLDVILLE FOR A LET'S-BE-FRIENDS DINNER OF ROAST CHICKEN AND CREPES SUZETTE WITH LEADERS OF THE CONGOLESE ARMY, THEN SWORE OATHS OF ALLEGIANCE TO THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT . EVEN TSHOMBE'S ERSTWHILE AFRICAN ALLIES WERE RE-EXAMINING THEIR RELATIONS WITH LEOPOLDVILLE . FIRST TO BURY THE HATCHET WAS PRESIDENT FULBERT YOULOU OF THE CONGO REPUBLIC, FORMERLY THE FRENCH CONGO, WHOSE CAPITAL CITY OF BRAZZAVILLE LIES ACROSS THE RIVER FROM LEOPOLDVILLE . YOULOU, A NON-PRACTICING ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIEST WHO STUBBORNLY CONTINUES TO WEAR HIS CASSOCK, SUPPORTED TSHOMBE'S SECESSION IN 1960 . BUT WITH TSHOMBE ON THE WAY OUT, YOULOU SUDDENLY SAILED ACROSS THE STANLEY POOL TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH THE LEOPOLDVILLE CROWD . THEN, LOOKING LIKE A SHORTER, SUNTANNED VERSION OF SONNY LISTON, HE TOOK OFF ON A FIVE-DAY TOUR OF THE COUNTRY WITH LEOPOLDVILLE'S PRESIDENT JOSEPH KASAVUBU . THE CONGOLESE BORE NO GRUDGE . THE DAY YOULOU LEFT FOR HOME, SCHOOL WAS CANCELED IN LEOPOLDVILLE SO THE CHILDREN COULD LINE HIS DEPARTURE ROUTE . </p>
