        <p>WEST GERMANY LOOKING EASTWARD FOR YEARS, THE WEST GERMAN GOVERNMENT HAS NURSED A CERTAIN LONGING FOR CLOSER TIES WITH NEIGHBORING EASTERN EUROPE, IN PART BECAUSE MOSCOW'S UNDERDEVELOPED SATELLITES WOULD BE A JUICY MARKET FOR BONN'S HEAVY INDUSTRIAL GOODS . BUT COMMUNIST POLAND, FOR ONE, KEPT INSISTING ON A MAJOR POLITICAL SURRENDER BEFORE ANY DEAL WAS SIGNED : FULL DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION OF WLADYSLAW GOMULKA'S POLISH REGIME, AND ACCEPTANCE OF POLAND'S ODERNEISSE WESTERN FRONTIER, WHICH INCLUDES A BIG CHUNK OF PRE-WORLD WAR II GERMANY . WITH 14 MILLION ANGRY REFUGEES FROM THE EAST ADDED TO ITS POPULATION SINCE THE WAR, THE BONN GOVERNMENT COULD HARDLY SWALLOW THAT KIND OF PROPOSITION . LAST WEEK, AFTER THREE MONTHS OF DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS IN WARSAW, POLAND AT LAST DROPPED ITS TOUGH DEMANDS, AND THE TWO SIDES SIGNED THEIR FIRST LONG-TERM TRADE AGREEMENT, A THREE-YEAR, $650 MILLION PACT EXCHANGING WEST GERMAN MACHINERY AND METALS FOR POLISH MEAT, FRUIT AND DAIRY PRODUCTS . WEST GERMANY WILL SEND A PERMANENT TRADE MISSION TO WARSAW, ITS FIRST PERMANENT OUTPOST IN A SOVIET SATELLITE LAND . BONN OFFICIALS CLEARLY FEEL THE WAY IS OPEN FOR SIMILAR DEALS WITH HUNGARY AND CZECHOSLOVAKIA . </p>
