        <p>FORMOSA INVASIONS, LTD . ON THE ROCKY ISLAND OF TUNGYIN, 50 MILES OFF THE COAST OF RED CHINA, IS THE HEADQUARTERS OF A LITTLE-KNOWN MILITARY UNIT CALLED THE ANTI-COMMUNIST NATIONAL SALVATION ARMY . THE SECRET ARMY, 30,000 STRONG, IS CHIANG KAI-SHEK'S INSTRUMENT FOR THE LONG-PROMISED RETURN TO THE MAINLAND . THE TROOPS ARE TRAINED AS GUERRILLAS, ARMED WITH US  WEAPONS, AND COME LARGELY FROM THE MAINLAND COASTAL PROVINCES . BUT WHERE THE TROOPS GO OR WHAT THEY DO IS A TIGHT SECRET . THAT SECRECY MADE A NEWS ITEM FROM RED CHINA ALL THE MORE INTERESTING LAST WEEK . RADIO PEKING TRUMPETED AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT COMMUNIST SECURITY FORCES HAD " WIPED OUT " 172 COMMANDOS WHO HAD SECRETLY LANDED IN COASTAL KWANGTUNG PROVINCE LAST FALL . THE COMMUNISTS CLAIMED THAT THE INTERLOPERS PLANNED TO SET UP A " GUERRILLA CORRIDOR " IN KWANGTUNG " TO OPEN THE WAY FOR A SUBSEQUENT MILITARY ADVENTURE OF INVADING THE MAINLAND . " TO BACK UP THE STORY, COMMUNIST NEWSPAPERS SPLASHED FRONT-PAGE PICTURES OF THE CAPTURED AGENTS AND THEIR STOCKPILES OF US  RIFLES, GRENADES, AND PLASTIC DEMOLITION EQUIPMENT . THE STORY MIGHT HAVE BEEN BRUSHED ASIDE AS ANOTHER PROPAGANDA TIDBIT, BUT THE OFFICIAL NATIONALIST CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY QUICKLY VERIFIED IT . WHAT'S MORE, CLAIMED TAIPEI, THE GUERRILLAS TIED UP 100,000 COMMUNIST TROOPS FOR THREE MONTHS, INFLICTED 700 CASUALTIES, SHOT DOWN A RED RECONNAISSANCE PLANE, AND ENGAGED IN A WIDESPREAD CAMPAIGN OF SABOTAGE . </p>
