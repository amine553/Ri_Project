        <p>RUSSIA PARTY TIME THE NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY WAS GOING FULL BLAST IN THE BANQUET HALL ATOP THE KREMLIN'S PALACE OF CONGRESSES . COMMUNIST BIGWIGS MINGLED WITH DIPLOMATS, MILITARY LEADERS AND STARS OF THE SOVIET CULTURAL ELITE . EVERYONE WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS, INCLUDING SOVIET EX-PRESIDENT KLIMENT VOROSHILOV, 82, WHO BROKE INTO AN IMPROMPTU JIG WHEN THE BAND PLAYED A SNAPPY RUSSIAN MELODY . GENIAL HOST NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV ROARED HIS HEARTY APPROVAL . IT WAS NO OCCASION FOR DISHARMONIOUS WORDS, SO WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR SPEECHES, NIKITA WAVED AWAY THE LATEST 20,000-WORD ATTACK ON HIS POLICIES BY RED CHINA . EVERY FAMILY HAS TROUBLES, KHRUSHCHEV DECLARED, GESTURING AMIABLY AT THE WESTERN DIPLOMATS IN THE CROWD . " YOU JUST GET MARRIED AND YOU WILL SOON NOTICE THAT DIFFERENCES DEVELOP . " AS FOR HIS DIFFERENCES WITH THE WEST, KHRUSHCHEV HOPED THAT 1963 WOULD SOLVE " URGENT PROBLEMS FRAUGHT WITH NEW CRISES, " A BIT OF DOUBLETALK ABOUT BERLIN THAT COULD FIT ANY EVENTUALITY . THE FIRST WOULD PROBABLY COME AT NEXT WEEK'S CONGRESS OF THE EAST GERMAN COMMUNIST PARTY, WHICH KHRUSHCHEV WILL ATTEND . LAST WEEK, WHEN THE US  MOVED 1,500 INFANTRYMEN BY HIGHWAY INTO THE DIVIDED CITY IN A ROUTINE SHIFT OF REGIMENTS, THERE WAS NOT A MOMENT OF OBSTRUCTIONIST DELAY AT THE RUSSIAN CHECKPOINT . READY TO GREET THE FRESH TROOPS WAS A NEW US  WEST BERLIN COMMANDANT, MAJOR GENERAL JAMES H . POLK, 51 . SAID POLK, IN A MESSAGE TO WEST BERLINERS : " WE ARE HERE TO STAY . </p>
