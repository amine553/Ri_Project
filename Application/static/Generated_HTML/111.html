        <p>BURMA ARMY SOCIALISM EVER SINCE GENERAL NE WIN TOSSED BUMBLING PREMIER U NU OUT OF OFFICE LAST MARCH, THE ONLY THING THAT HAS KEPT HIM FROM RUSHING HEADLONG INTO A PROGRAM OF INDUSTRIAL NATIONALIZATION AND FARM COLLECTIVIZATION HAS BEEN THE INFLUENCE OF TOUGH, HANDSOME BRIGADIER AUNG GYI . LAST WEEK THE BRAKES WERE OFF . AFTER A LONG FEUD WITH LEFTIST MEMBERS IN THE 17-MAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, AUNG GYI " MOST RESPECTFULLY " ASKED STRONGMAN NE WIN " TO RELIEVE ME OF THE VARIOUS DUTIES TO WHICH I HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED . " AS ARMY VICE CHIEF OF STAFF, MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY, AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BURMA OIL CO., AUNG GYI WAS NE WIN'S NO . 2 MAN AND HEIR APPARENT . THE SON OF A WELL-TO-DO CHINESE TEXTILE MERCHANT AND A BURMESE WOMAN, HE PROVED HIMSELF A CANNY DIPLOMAT BOTH IN THE 1960 NEGOTIATIONS THAT FIXED BURMA'S BORDERS WITH RED CHINA AND IN LAST MONTH'S TALKS WITH JAPAN THAT PRODUCED $170 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL WORLD WAR II REPARATIONS AND LOANS . DESPITE HIS INSISTENCE THAT " I HAVE NO TRAINING IN ECONOMICS, / HE BUILT A MODEST ARMY PX-TYPE OPERATION INTO THE GIANT BURMA ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORP., RUNNING 34 FIRMS RANGING FROM BANKING TO FISHERIES AND TURNING HANDSOME PROFITS THAT IN SOME YEARS RAN AS HIGH AS $2,500,000 . THOUGH HE INSISTED THAT HE HAD BEEN A SOCIALIST FOR 20 YEARS AND INTENDED TO REMAIN ONE FOR 20 MORE, IN FACT, HE WAS A TOUGH-MINDED PRAGMATIST WHO OPENLY ADVOCATED COOPERATION WITH PRIVATE INDUSTRY . INEVITABLY, AUNG GYI'S GRADUALISM ANNOYED NE WIN, A SOLDIER WHO IS NO COMMUNIST BUT HAS VOWED TO SOCIALIZE BURMA AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE . AUNG GYI EARNED THE ENMITY OF BRIGADIER TIN PE, A MARXIST THEORIST AND A KEY MEMBER OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL . FOR MONTHS, TIN PE PRESSED FOR A FASTER SWITCHOVER TO STATE CONTROL ; AUNG GYI'S DEPARTURE MEANS THAT TIN PE HAS FINALLY WON OUT . STRIPPED OF POWER, AUNG GYI, 43, FLEW OFF TO VOLUNTARY EXILE IN AN ISOLATED BURMESE VILLAGE NEAR THE BORDERS OF CHINA AND INDIA . AT LEAST FOUR HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS WHO SHARED HIS VIEWS WERE ARRESTED OR FORCED INTO RETIREMENT . WITH THE OPPOSITION OUT OF THE WAY, NE WIN DECLARED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD IMMEDIATELY TAKE OVER THE IMPORT AND EXPORT BUSINESS, THE RICE TRADE AND SOME PRIVATE INDUSTRIES . BURMA'S ECONOMY, SAID HE, WOULD NOW COME UNDER " TOTAL STATE CONTROL . / </p>
