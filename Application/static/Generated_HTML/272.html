        <p>SENEGAL BRIEFLY SYMPATHETIC ONE MIGHT SAY THAT THINGS WERE RIGGED IN ADVANCE WHEN EX-PREMIER MAMADOU DIA WENT ON TRIAL LAST WEEK FOR ATTEMPTING TO SEIZE POWER IN DECEMBER . AFTER ALL, SIX OF THE SEVEN " JUDGES " WERE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY THAT DIA HAD TRIED TO DISSOLVE BY FORCE DURING THE ABORTIVE COUP . THEY JUST MIGHT BE A LITTLE PREJUDICED . BUT WHEN THE PROCEEDINGS BEGAN, THE COURT WAS CAREFUL TO OBSERVE ALL THE FLOWERY DECORUM OF GALLIC JUSTICE . THE PRESIDING JUDGE WAS RESPLENDENT IN ERMINETRIMMED LONG RED ROBES, AND SAT LISTENING WITH CALM DIGNITY . MOREOVER, DIA WAS NOT EVEN CHARGED WITH " PLOTTING, " ONLY WITH THE MORE VAGUE " ACTING AGAINST THE INTERNAL SECURITY OF THE STATE . " TAKING THE FLOOR IN HIS OWN DEFENSE, DIA ARGUED THAT HE WAS NOT GUILTY OF THE CHARGES . WHEN HE SENT GENDARMES TO OVERTHROW PRESIDENT LEOPOLD SENGHOR AND ARREST PRO-SENGHOR DEPUTIES, DIA SAID, HE WAS ONLY TRYING TO HEAD OFF A PLOT AGAINST HIMSELF THAT STEMMED FROM HIS EFFORTS TO CRACK SENEGAL'S PEANUT MONOPOLISTS . CRIED DIA : " I WANTED A CONSTITUTIONAL SOLUTION, THEY (SENGHOR'S MEN) WANTED A POLITICAL ONE . " IN REPLY, THE PROSECUTOR SOUNDED DOWNRIGHT SYMPATHETIC . THERE WERE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES, HE AGREED ; DIA WAS OBVIOUSLY A MISGUIDED PATRIOT WHO " THOUGHT THAT ONE COULD NOT BE A GOOD SENEGALESE WHEN ONE WAS AGAINST MAMADOU DIA . " BUT AT WEEK'S END THE COURT GAVELED AN END TO COURTLINESS . AFTER TWO HOURS AND 15 MINUTES OF DELIBERATION, THE JUSTICES SENTENCED DIA TO THE MAXIMUM PENALTY, LIFE IMPRISONMENT . </p>
