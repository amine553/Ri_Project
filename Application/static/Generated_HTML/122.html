        <p>LAOS AND THEN THERE WERE THREE IN THE EIGHT MONTHS SINCE THE 14-NATION GENEVA CONFERENCE ESTABLISHED LAOTIAN NEUTRALITY LAST SUMMER, NEUTRALIST PRINCE SOUVANNA PHOUMA'S LEFT-RIGHT-CENTER COALITION GOVERNMENT HAS DISPLAYED A REMARKABLE RECORD OF CONSISTENCY : IT HAS FAILED TO CARRY OUT ONE SINGLE PROVISION OF THE GENEVA ACCORDS . RENT BY INTERNAL DISSENSION, THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN UNABLE TO MAINTAIN A CEASE-FIRE, EVICT ALL FOREIGN MILITARY PERSONNEL FROM LAOS, INTEGRATE THE THREE MILITARY AND POLITICAL FACTIONS, OR HOLD FREE ELECTIONS . BUT THE SUPPOSEDLY " NEUTRALIST " GOVERNMENT HAS RECOGNIZED EVERY COUNTRY IN THE COMMUNIST BLOC, AND HAS DONE SO LITTLE TO HALT THE RAMPANT INFLATION THAT THE PRICE OF THE KIP HAS RISEN FROM 80 TO 180 PER DOLLAR . ON THE PLAINE DES JARRES, HEADQUARTERS OF BOTH THE NEUTRALIST AND COMMUNIST PATHET LAO ARMIES, THE REDS HAVE BEGUN A CAMPAIGN TO INFILTRATE AND SUBVERT THE FORCES OF THEIR ONETIME NEUTRALIST ALLIES . FARTHER NORTH, THOUSANDS OF RED CHINESE WORKERS HAVE CROSSED INTO LAOS TO BUILD ROADS LINKING CHINA'S YUNNAN PROVINCE WITH COMMUNIST-HELD AREAS OF LAOS ITSELF . ARMED WITH NEW RED CHINESE AUTOMATIC WEAPONS, THE PATHET LAO IS ATTACKING NEUTRALIST VILLAGES ON THE SUPPLY LINES BETWEEN THE PLAINE DES JARRES AND COMMUNIST NORTH VIET NAM TO THE EAST . MANY NEUTRALISTS HAVE OPENLY DEFECTED TO THE REDS, ADDING TO WESTERNERS' FEARS THAT LAOS IS GOING TO THE COMMUNISTS BY DEFAULT . THE REDS' PERSISTENT SUBVERSION IS ALIENATING THE TOP NEUTRALIST COMMANDERS, AND LAST WEEK AN OPEN SPLIT SEEMED A POSSIBILITY . WHILE SHOWING A MOVIE AT HIS HOUSE ON THE PLAINE DES JARRES, THE NEUTRALIST ARMY'S SECOND IN COMMAND, COLONEL KETSANA VONGSOUVANH, WAS SHOT IN THE BACK . AT KETSANA'S FUNERAL LAST WEEK, NEUTRALIST ARMY LEADER GENERAL KONG LE, WHO ONCE WORKED HAND IN GLOVE WITH THE PATHET LAO, MADE NO EFFORT TO CONCEAL HIS DISENCHANTMENT WITH HIS FORMER COHORTS . " THIS ODIOUS CRIME, " SAID KONG LE, " WAS THE WORK OF THOSE WHO ARE UNDER A FOREIGN INFLUENCE . " KONG LE RESTRICTED HIS TROOPS TO THEIR BASE, ORDERED THE PATHET LAO TO KEEP OUT OF NEUTRALIST ENCAMPMENTS . TOP NEUTRALIST OFFICERS WONDERED WHERE THE REDS WOULD STRIKE NEXT . ONE RECALLED THAT A RANKING PATHET LAO OFFICER TOLD HIM LAST FALL THAT THE COMMUNISTS HAD PLANS FOR KONG LE'S TOP FOUR SUBORDINATES . WE ARE GOING TO THOROUGHLY LIQUIDATE ALL FOUR OF YOU . " WITH KETSANA'S DEATH, THERE WAS ONE DOWN AND THREE TO GO . </p>
