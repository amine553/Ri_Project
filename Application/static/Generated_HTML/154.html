        <p>RUSSIA TOSCA & A COLD CLIMATE OUT OF THE SOVIET BOONDOCKS COMES A RISING TIDE OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE KIND OF PEOPLE THE MOSCOW AUTHORITIES SEND OUT TO THE HINTERLAND . TOO OFTEN, THEY ARE TROUBLEMAKERS WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE REFORMED THROUGH HARD WORK . INSTEAD, THEY JUST MAKE MORE TROUBLE . IN VLADIVOSTOK EXILED YOUNG TOUGHS FORMED A BANDIT GANG THAT TERRORIZED THE CITY AND KNIFED TO DEATH A YOUNG COMMUNIST LEADER ; DEPORTEES TO A UKRAINIAN COLLECTIVE FARM LAST YEAR DRANK SO MUCH BOOZE THAT THEY WERE BARRED FROM THE LIQUOR STORES, TURNED IN DESPERATION TO EAU DE COLOGNE . LAST WEEK CAME AN ANGRY GRIPE IN LITERATURNAYA GAZETA FROM A SIBERIAN HOUSEWIFE WHO DEMANDED THAT LENINGRAD STOP SENDING ITS PROSTITUTES 2,735 MILES TO IRKUTSK AND SURROUNDING VILLAGES . THE HOUSEWIFE WAS ESPECIALLY UPSET ABOUT A YOUNG LADY NAMED TOSCA, WHOSE FAME WAS SO GREAT THAT IT PRECEDED HER ARRIVAL IN SIBERIA . " WON'T THIS PIECE OF GOODS FIND ADMIRERS EVEN IN A NEW PLACE ? " ASKED THE MATRON . " SHE PROBABLY WILL . I KNOW THAT THE WIVES OF A FEW BODAIBO MINERS, FOR EXAMPLE, ASKED THE AUTHORITIES TO STOP SENDING THE LIKES OF TOSCA TO BODAIBO . THIS DESIRE TO PUSH THEIR UNFINISHED GOODS ONTO OTHERS IS WRONG . </p>
