        <p>AFRO-ASIA MISHMASH AT MOSHI IT WAS BILLED AS THE THIRD AFRO-ASIAN PEOPLE'S SOLIDARITY CONFERENCE . BUT DISCORD TURNED OUT TO BE SOLIDARITY'S DOMINANT THEME WHEN THE 400 DELEGATES AND OBSERVERS GATHERED AT MOSHI, A HAMLET ON THE COFFEE SLOPES OF MOUNT KILIMANJARO . SETTING THE TONE OF THE AFFAIR WAS RELUCTANT HOST JULIUS NYERERE, PRESIDENT OF TANGANYIKA, WHO HAD NOT WANTED THE MEETING HELD IN HIS COUNTRY IN THE FIRST PLACE . TO THE COMMUNISTS AND THEIR PALS, HE WARNED THAT AFRICA AND ASIA ARE IMPERILED BY A " SECOND SCRAMBLE " OF COLONIZATION, LED THIS TIME BY COMMUNIST POWERS, " WHO ARE COMMITTING THE SAME CRIME AS THE CAPITALISTS BEFORE . " SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THE HEAD OF THE INDIAN DELEGATION DENOUNCED THE ORGANIZATION AS A " FRAUD, / STOMPED OUT OF THE HALL BECAUSE HIS NEUTRALIST RESOLUTION ON THE SINO-INDIAN DISPUTE WAS TORPEDOED . DURING A DEBATE ON MALAYSIA, THE DELEGATE FROM SINGAPORE WAS BARRED, AND AN INDONESIAN WAS ACCEPTED AS BRUNEI'S REPRESENTATIVE . THE RUSSIANS AND RED CHINESE DELEGATIONS CARRIED THEIR OWN SQUABBLE INTO AFRICA . THERE WERE WIDESPREAD SUSPICIONS THAT THE CHINESE WERE TO BLAME WHEN THE AMPLIFIER FOR THE RUSSIAN TRANSLATION HOOKUP DISAPPEARED, WAS LATER FOUND IN A DITCH OUTSIDE THE CONFERENCE HALL . TIT FOLLOWED TAT . NEXT DAY THE CHINESE EARPHONES WENT DEAD, AND A BRITISH ENGINEER SUMMONED TO FIX THEM FOUND THAT THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTION HAD BEEN SPIKED . </p>
