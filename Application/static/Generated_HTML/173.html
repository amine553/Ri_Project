        <p>SWEDEN CAUGHT IN A DROUGHT WHEN 40 YEARS OF LIQUOR RATIONING ENDED IN 1955, MOST SWEDES LAID IN AMPLE RESERVE STOCKS, VOWING NEVER TO BE CAUGHT SHORT AGAIN . BUT THERE THEY WERE, WITH CUPBOARDS BARE LAST WEEK, AMIDST THE DIREST SHORTAGE SINCE THE HEIGHT OF GOVERNMENT CONTROLS . TROUBLE FOR THE HARD-DRINKING SWEDES BEGAN WHEN FOREMEN OF THE STATE WINE AND LIQUOR MONOPOLY DISTILLERIES WENT OUT ON STRIKE FOUR WEEKS AGO . THE GOVERNMENT DECLINED THEIR DEMANDS FOR LONGER VACATIONS . AS A RESULT, THE DISTILLERIES CLOSED UP TIGHT, AND THE COUNTRY BEGAN TO DRY UP FAST . LAST WEEK WINES, WHISKIES AND LIQUEURS WERE ALL BUT GONE, AND, EVEN WORSE, THE SHOPS WERE RUNNING OUT OF AKVAVIT, SWEDEN'S FAVORITE DRINK . AS ALARMED SWEDES LINED UP AT STATERUN PACKAGE STORES TO BUY WHAT THEY COULD, THE GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED AKVAVIT SALES TO A BOTTLE PER CUSTOMER . AND WORD WENT OUT THAT UNLESS SOMETHING IS DONE THIS WEEK, FULLY A THIRD OF ALL SWEDEN'S LIQUOR STORES WILL BE OUT OF AKVAVIT ALTOGETHER . BOOTLEGGERS TURNED UP FURTIVELY WITH THE POPULAR BRANNVIN AKVAVIT, ASKING $20 FOR THE BOTTLE WHICH NORMALLY SELLS FOR $5 . " A DISASTER, " MUTTERED ONE SWEDE, WAITING HIS TURN IN A STOCKHOLM QUEUE . IN THE SOUTH, SOME DESPERATE SWEDES WERE EVEN HOPPING FERRIES ACROSS TO DENMARK TO SEEK RELIEF AT COPENHAGEN BARS . RESTRICTING MOST MEN TO THREE QUARTS PER MONTH, AUSTERE BY SWEDISH STANDARDS . </p>
