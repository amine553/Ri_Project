        <p>FRANCE AN ISLAND FLING FRANCE'S PREMIER MICHEL DEBRE LAST WEEK RUSHED FROM HUMILIATING OBSCURITY BACK TO THE VERY CENTER OF FRENCH POLITICAL LIFE . EASED OUT OF OFFICE BY PRESIDENT CHARLES DE GAULLE IN 1962 AND REPLACED BY GEORGES POMPIDOU, DEBRE HAD SEEMED PERMANENTLY RELEGATED TO THE SHADOWS LAST NOVEMBER WHEN HE RAN AS A CANDIDATE FOR THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY IN A SUPPOSEDLY SAFE CONSTITUENCY AND, DESPITE A GAULLIST LANDSLIDE, WAS SOLIDLY BEATEN BY A LOCAL GARAGE OWNER . BUT DEBRE WAS DETERMINED TO TRY AGAIN, EVEN THOUGH HE HAD TO TRAVEL 6,000 MILES TO FRENCH-OWNED REUNION ISLAND, A TINY VOLCANIC ROCK IN THE INDIAN OCEAN, WHERE A BY-ELECTION OFFERED ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO RUN FOR THE ASSEMBLY . THE DOUR, FUSSY DEBRE TOOK NO CHANCES . HE FLEW TO THE CAPITAL CITY OF ST.-DENIS AND CAMPAIGNED VIGOROUSLY, HOLDING 70 MEETINGS IN THREE STEAMING, SWEATY WEEKS . AS WAS CONFIDENTLY PREDICTED, DEBRE SWAMPED HIS LUCKLESS OPPONENT 30,908 TO 7,365, PARTLY THROUGH THE REUNION TACTIC KNOWN AS THE " PROMENADE, " IN WHICH OPPOSITION VOTERS ARE SENT FRUITLESSLY FROM POLLING PLACE TO POLLING PLACE, BEING TOLD AT EACH THAT THEY ARE NOT REGISTERED THERE . DE GAULLE NOW VIEWS DEBRE WITH A MORE KINDLY EYE THAN HE DID DURING HIS PREMIERSHIP A YEAR AGO ; ACCORDING TO WAGGISH PARIS COMMENT, POMPIDOU WAS LIKE A MISTRESS WHOM DE GAULLE SAW WITH PLEASURE, BUT WHO LOST MANY OF HIS CHARMS WHEN HE BECAME LA LEGITIME, THAT IS, WIFE . IF DE GAULLE GIVES THE EXPECTED NOD, MICHEL DEBRE WILL TAKE OVER THE JOB OF PRESIDENT OF THE GAULLIST UNR  FACTION IN THE ASSEMBLY AND EMPLOY HIS UNDENIABLE TALENTS IN DEALING WITH THE INEFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP, POOR ORGANIZATION AND INTERNAL FRICTION THAT HAVE RECENTLY PLAGUED THE PARTY </p>
