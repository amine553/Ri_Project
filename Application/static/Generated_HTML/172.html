        <p>FRANCE 6,000 MILES FROM HOME FORMER PREMIER MICHEL DEBRE IS SUCH A LISTLESS POLITICAL PERSONALITY THAT A CURRENT JOKE SAYS HE WAS ONCE SEEN RIDING IN AN EMPTY LIMOUSINE . HE HAS A FUSSY MANNER AND A FLAT- WHINING VOICE THAT SOMEHOW RUB POLITICIANS AND MANY OTHER FRENCHMEN THE WRONG WAY, OBSCURING HIS CONSIDERABLE ADMINISTRATIVE TALENTS . IN CHARLES DE GAULLE'S ELECTORAL LANDSLIDE LAST NOVEMBER, DEBRE THE DEDICATED GAULLIST, MAJOR ARCHITECT OF THE FIFTH REPUBLIC'S CONSTITUTION, AND THE MAN WHO SERVED A LONGER UNINTERRUPTED PERIOD AS PREMIER (1,193 DAYS) THAN ANY OTHER IN FRENCH PARLIAMENTARY HISTORY WAS IGNOMINIOUSLY DEFEATED IN HIS OWN CAREFULLY CULTIVATED RURAL CONSTITUENCY BY A LOCAL GARAGE OWNER . DE GAULLE, WHO HIMSELF HAD USED DEBRE AS WHIPPING BOY FOR MANY OF THE REGIME'S MISTAKES, SOON FOUND, HOWEVER, THAT HE SORELY MISSED DEBRE'S PARLIAMENTARY SKILL . GAULLIST AIDES BEGAN TO PONDER WAYS TO GET HIM BACK INTO THE LEGISLATURE, WHERE, IF ELECTED, HE WAS LIKELY TO BECOME MAJORITY LEADER . TROUBLE WAS, NO GAULLIST FACTION IN FRANCE ITSELF WANTED HIM . BUT AT LAST A CONSTITUENCY WAS FOUND WHERE DEBRE SEEMED UNLIKELY TO LOSE WEEK THE FORMER PREMIER GULPED HARD AND ACCEPTED A BID TO RUN FOR OFFICE ON REUNION ISLAND, A TINY FRENCH DOT IN THE INDIAN OCEAN NEARLY 6,000 MILES FROM PARIS . </p>
