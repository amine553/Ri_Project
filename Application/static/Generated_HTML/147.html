        <p>YUGOSLAVIA RETURN OF THE BAKER THROUGH ALL THE YEARS OF MARSHAL TITO'S COMMUNIST RULE, A SPECIAL NICHE HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR THE SMALL PRIVATE BUSINESSMAN WHO WAS SOMEHOW ABLE TO SUPPLY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THE STATE-CONTROLLED ORGANIZATION COULD NOT MATCH . BUT A YEAR OR SO AGO, THE PROFITS OF THE BARBERS, BLACKSMITHS, PASTRYMAKERS, COBBLERS AND TAILORS BEGAN TO GET OUT OF HAND ; THEY BOUGHT CARS AND RENTED SUMMER HOMES ON FASHIONABLE LAKESIDES . LAST MAY TITO'S REGIME DECIDED TO WIPE THEM OUT . TAXES ON PRIVATE BUSINESS WERE RAISED SEVENFOLD . A PRIVATE TAILOR WITH ONE HELPER PAID THE SAME AMOUNT OF TAX AS A BELGRADE TAILORS' COMMUNIST COOPERATIVE WITH SEVEN EMPLOYEES . IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR ANY ARTISAN . BY THE END OF 1962, NEARLY 10,000 PRIVATE CRAFTSMEN CLOSED UP SHOP, 3,000 IN CROATIA ALONE . THE THEORETICIANS WERE HAPPY AT THE TURN OF EVENTS, BUT MANY OTHER YUGOSLAVS WERE NOT . THEY FOUND IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE IN SOME AREAS TO OBTAIN THE SERVICES OF A PLUMBER OR ELECTRICIAN . TO GET A PAIR OF SHOES REPAIRED TODAY TAKES A MONTH . BELGRADE'S FAMED CANDY AND PASTRY SHOPS ARE NEARLY ALL CLOSED, AND THE STATE-BAKED PITA A SERBIAN PASTRY FILLED WITH FRUIT IS NO EDIBLE SUBSTITUTE . THE GRUMBLING GOT SO LOUD THAT EVEN PRESIDENT TITO ADMITTED IN A SPEECH THAT " A REAL WITCH HUNT WAS STARTED AGAINST THE ALLEGED ENRICHMENT OF ARTISANS, AND EXCESSIVELY HIGH TAXES WERE LEVIED AGAINST THEM . " HE SUGGESTED THE MATTER BE ATTENDED TO . LAST WEEK THE YUGOSLAV PARLIAMENT WAS PREPARING TO PASS A NEW TAX LAW THAT " WILL NOT DISCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRAFTS . " THE PARTY'S OFFICIAL MOUTHPIECE, BELGRADE'S DAILY BORBA, OFFERED A DISTINCTLY NON-MARXIAN RATIONALE FOR THE RETREAT : " THE LAW TREATS PRIVATE CRAFTSMEN AS AN ADDITIONAL BUT SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC BRANCH WHICH FITS WELL IN THE SYSTEM OF SOCIALIST ECONOMY . / </p>
