        <p>ESPIONAGE MISTAKEN IDENTITIES LATEST INSTALLMENTS OF TWO INTERNATIONAL SPY CASES : IN LONDON'S OLD BAILEY, A JURY PONDERED THE CROWN'S CASE AGAINST ITALIAN NUCLEAR SCIENTIST GIUSEPPE MARTELLI, INCLUDING THE ELABORATE ESPIONAGE EQUIPMENT FOUND IN HIS POSSESSION AND HIS REPEATED CONTACTS WITH KNOWN SOVIET AGENTS . DEFENDANT MARTELLI READILY ADMITTED MOST OF THE CROWN'S CHARGES, BUT EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD MERELY BEEN STRINGING OUT THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE REDS IN ORDER TO DENOUNCE THEM AT THE RIGHT MOMENT TO BRITISH AUTHORITIES . AFTER DELIBERATING FOR NINE HOURS AND 47 MINUTES, THE JURORS DECIDED TO BELIEVE MARTELLI AND DECLARED HIM NOT GUILTY . IN BOTH LONDON AND MOSCOW, THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE CONFUSION ABOUT THE IMPORTANT SOVIET OFFICIAL WHO DEFECTED TO THE WEST 18 MONTHS AGO, WAS THOROUGHLY INTERROGATED IN THE US, AND IS NOW A RESIDENT OF BRITAIN . THE MAN'S NAME WAS GIVEN AS ANATOLY DOLNYTSIN, AND THE DAILY TELEGRAPH ALERTLY NOTED THAT A DIPLOMAT OF THE SAME NAME HAD SERVED FOR NINE MONTHS IN THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN LONDON . MOSCOW'S IZVESTIA THEN GOT INTO THE ACT, INSISTING THAT, FAR FROM DEFECTING, DOLNYTSIN HAD LEFT HIS LONDON POST IN 1961 AND HAD BEEN WORKING EVER SINCE AT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY IN MOSCOW (TO PROVE ITS POINT, IZVESTIA EVEN PUBLISHED HIS PICTURE) . QUESTIONS RAISED IN BRITAIN'S HOUSE OF COMMONS GOT ONLY AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT SOMEBODY DID DEFECT FROM RUSSIA 18 MONTHS AGO AND HAD BEEN GIVEN ASYLUM IN BRITAIN . POSSIBLY, THERE HAD BEEN TWO RUSSIAN OFFICIALS WITH THE SAME OR SIMILAR NAMES . NOW WILL THE REAL ANATOLY DOLNYTSIN PLEASE STAND UP ? </p>
