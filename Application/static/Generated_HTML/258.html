        <p>TOGO ARRANGING THINGS FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT SYLVANUS OLYMPIO BY A DISGRUNTLED ARMY SERGEANT, THE TOGOLESE ELECTORATE WENT DUTIFULLY TO THE POLLS THIS WEEK TO CHOOSE A NEW GOVERNMENT . THERE WAS LITTLE SUSPENSE ABOUT THE OUTCOME . THE VOTERS, HANDED A SINGLE LIST, COULY ONLY RUBBER-STAMP THE MILITARY-BACKED REGIME THAT HAS SUCCEEDED OLYMPIO IN THE TINY WEST AFRICAN REPUBLIC . SLATED FOR A CONTINUED FIVE-YEAR TERM AS PRESIDENT IS NICOLAS GRUNITZKY, 50, THE MULATTO SON OF A PRUSSIAN DOCTOR AND TOGOLESE MOTHER WHO HEADED A PRO-FRENCH PUPPET REGIME BEFORE OLYMPIO GAINED INDEPENDENCE FROM PARIS IN 1960, AND WHO WAS CALLED UPON TO TAKE OVER AS PROVISIONAL PRESIDENT LAST JANUARY . TICKETED TO STAY ON AS VICE PRESIDENT WAS ANTOINE MEATCHI, 37, A TALL, AMBITIOUS NORTHERN TRIBESMAN . TO KEEP THE VARIOUS PARTY FACTIONS HAPPY, THE ELECTION ORGANIZERS AGREED IN ADVANCE ON THE MAKEUP OF A 56-MEMBER NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, DIVIDED AMONG VIRTUALLY ALL POLITICAL PARTIES, INCLUDING OLYMPIO'S COMITE D'UNION UNITE TOGOLAISE AND ITS ONETIME YOUTH WING, JUVENTO,* SO THAT NONE HAS A MAJORITY . BACKING UP THE WHOLE PACKAGE IS TOGO'S FRENCH-TRAINED ARMY, WHOSE DISCONTENT OVER LOW PAY AND MANPOWER LED TO OLYMPIO'S OVERTHROW . ITS RANKS HAVE SINCE BEEN DOUBLED TO 550 MEN . PERHAPS THE WORLD'S GRANDEST PARTY LABEL, JUVENTO TAKES ITS NAME FROM THE FIRST LETTERS OF THE FRENCH WORDS : JUSTICE, UNION, VIGILANCE, EGALITE, NATIONALISME, TENACITE AND OPTIMISME . </p>
