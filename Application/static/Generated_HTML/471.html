        <p>FRANCE COPING WITH AN OLD FOE THE JOKE IN PARIS WAS THAT CHARLES DE GAULLE DID NOT KNOW BIFTECK PRICES WERE GOING UP UNTIL HIS WIFE, TANTE YVONNE, TOLD HIM . WHEREVER DE GAULLE GOT THE NEWS ABOUT FRENCH INFLATION, HE MOVED SWIFTLY LAST WEEK TO BRING IT UNDER CONTROL . INFLATION IS AS TYPICALLY FRENCH AS ARE STREET DEMONSTRATIONS AND OFTEN THE TWO ARE LINKED . ALL FRENCH GOVERNMENTS TEND TO GRAPPLE VAINLY WITH THE PROBLEM . PREMIER PAUL RAMADIER FOUGHT A GAME BUT LOSING BATTLE IN 1947 ; PREMIER ANTOINE PINAY LAUNCHED A " SAVE THE FRANC " CAMPAIGN IN 1952 . NOW DE GAULLE IS STRUGGLING AGAINST THE SAME HYDRAHEADED ENEMY : RISING PRICES, UP 16 PER CENT IN THREE YEARS ; WAGE BOOSTS, WHICH ONLY INCREASE THE COST SPIRAL ; AND THE FURY OF FARMERS . IN AN UNUSUAL MOVE, DE GAULLE SUMMONED HIS CABINET DURING THE VACATION MONTH OF AUGUST, AND SOURLY NOTED THAT WITHOUT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL STABILITY FRANCE COULD NOT HAVE THE GLORIOUS " POLICY CONSISTENT WITH HER INTERESTS . " PREMIER GEORGES POMPIDOU, AN EX-BANKER, CANDIDLY SAID THAT ALL FRENCHMEN WERE JIGGLING TAX RETURNS A BIT IN THEIR OWN FAVOR, LAMENTED THAT " WHILE AN AMERICAN ALWAYS WANTS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT HE EARNS MORE THAN HIS NEIGHBOR, THE FRENCHMAN ALWAYS WANTS TO SHOW YOU HE EARNS LESS . " CREDIT RESTRICTIONS AND BUDGETARY MEASURES HIGHLIGHTED THE NEW CORRECTIVE PLAN ANNOUNCED BY THE GOVERNMENT LAST WEEK . BANKS ARE LIMITED TO A 10 PER CENT INCREASE IN LOAN PORTFOLIOS . INSTALLMENT BUYING HAS BEEN TIGHTENED BY INCREASING DOWN PAYMENTS . IN A NATIONWIDE TV SPEECH, FINANCE MINISTER VALERY GISCARD D'ESTAING SAID THE SUCCESS OF THE PLAN DEPENDS " ON TWO THINGS : CONSCIENCE AND CONFIDENCE . " THE PRESS WAS NEITHER HOSTILE NOR ENTHUSIASTIC . AS USUAL, CHARLES DE GAULLE HAD THE LAST WORD . TO HIS CABINET HE SAID, " IF THIS DOESN'T DO IT, WE'LL GO STILL FARTHER . " </p>
