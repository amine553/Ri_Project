        <p>TURKEY OLD HABITS BEFORE HIS FALL IN 1960, PREMIER ADNAN MENDERES MADE A PRACTICE OF PADLOCKING HOSTILE TURKISH NEWSPAPERS, IMPRISONED JOURNALISTS BY THE HUNDREDS . POLICE ONCE THREW A NEWSBOY INTO JAIL FOR HAWKING A HEADLINE ABOUT A MINISTER'S RESIGNATION . AT THE TIME, THE LOUDEST PROTESTS CAME FROM WISPY OLD OPPOSITION LEADER ISMET INONU, WHO DENOUNCED " THOSE WHO WOULD SEEK TO ESTABLISH A COERCIVE REGIME . " BUT NOW THAT HE IS IN POWER HIMSELF, PREMIER INONU, 78, SHOWS SIGNS OF FALLING INTO MENDERES' OLD HABITS . HAULING OUT A MENDERES-ERA LAW OUTLAWING ANY WRITTEN OR SPOKEN WORD AIMED AT DISTURBING " THE ESTABLISHED " ORDER, THE INONU REGIME LAST MONTH JAILED KAYHAN SAGLAMER, MANAGING EDITOR OF ISTANBUL'S INFLUENTIAL DAILY, CUMHURIYET, AND SADI ALKILIC, A FREELANCE WRITER . IT TURNED OUT THAT CUMHURIYET HAD PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE BY ALKILIC ENTITLED " SOCIALISM IS THE ONLY SALVATION FOR TURKEY " ONE OF A SCORE SUBMITTED IN THE NEWSPAPER'S ANNUAL ESSAY CONTEST . FORTNIGHT AGO, DR . ADNAN BENK, RESPECTED PROFESSOR OF PHILOLOGY AT ISTANBUL UNIVERSITY, AND AFSAR TIMUCIN, EDITOR OF THE CULTURAL MAGAZINE ATAC, WERE CLAPPED INTO PRISON FOR ANOTHER CRIME WITH WORDS . ATAC HAD CARRIED BENK'S TRANSLATION OF PARTS OF A BOOK THAT INCLUDED FOUR QUOTATIONS FROM KARL MARX . PRIOR TO RELEASING THE PAIR LAST WEEK ON BAIL, AN ISTANBUL JUDGE IGNORED BENK'S ARGUMENT THAT THE ENTIRE BOOK CAN BE READ IN THE ISTANBUL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY . SPECIFICALLY ACCUSED OF SPREADING COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA, THE FOUR DEFENDANTS, UNDER ARTICLE 142, COULD GET PRISON TERMS OF 15 YEARS . </p>
