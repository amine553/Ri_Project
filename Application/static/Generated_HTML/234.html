        <p>GREAT BRITAIN ALDERMASTON'S AMEN ? SINCE 1958, WHEN THE CAMPAIGN FOR NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT STAGED THE FIRST ALDERMASTON MARCH, ITS 52-MILE EASTER PARADE HAS TURNED INTO BRITAIN'S BIGGEST LUNATIC FRINGE BENEFIT . BEARDIES AND WEIRDIES SOON STOLE THE SPOTLIGHT FROM THE PACIFIST PARSONS AND LEFT-WING LABORITES WHO STARTED THE BAN-THE-BOMB MOVEMENT . IT ALSO BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE FOUR-DAY SHUFFLE WAS BEING MANIPULATED BY SUCH HIGHLY MOTIVATED " PILGRIMS " AS COMMUNIST AGITATORS, ANARCHISTS, AND A FEW THUGS TO BOOT . LAST WEEK, AFTER THE SIXTH ANNUAL SPECTACULAR ENDED IN BLISTERS AND BOMBAST IN HYDE PARK, MOST RESPONSIBLE BRITONS INCLUDING SEVERAL CND CO-FOUNDERS WERE MORE EAGER TO BAN THE MARCH THAN THE BOMB . THEIR DISILLUSIONMENT WAS THE RESULT OF A STRATAGEM THAT STRUCK EVEN THE TOLERANT BRITISH AS A DISLOYAL ACT . EVEN BEFORE THE MARCHERS LEFT ALDERMASTON, THERE APPEARED COPIES OF A CRUDELY MIMEOGRAPHED, TWELVEPAGE DOCUMENT HEADED : DANGER ! OFFICIAL SECRET . INSIDE, ITS ANONYMOUS AUTHORS DECLARED : " WE ARE SPIES FOR PEACE . WE HAVE DECIDED TO PUBLISH AN OFFICIAL SECRET . THERE ARE THOUSANDS MORE SECRETS IN CAPTIVITY . THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ONE WE SHALL RELEASE . " THE INFORMATION IT CONTAINED WAS, IN FACT, HIGHLY CLASSIFIED : THE LOCATIONS, CODE NAMES AND TELEPHONE NUMBERS OF TWELVE REGIONAL SEATS OF GOVERNMENT FROM WHICH BRITISH AUTHORITIES WOULD ATTEMPT TO RESTORE ORDER IN THE EVENT OF NUCLEAR ATTACK . " THIS, " EXCLAIMED HOME SECRETARY HENRY BROOKE, " IS THE WORK OF A TRAITOR . " BY NO COINCIDENCE, THE ONLY EMERGENCY HEADQUARTERS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL WAS RSG  6, AN UNDERGROUND BUNKER IN THE BERSIRE WOODS ALONG THE MARCHERS' ROUTE FROM READING TO LONDON . IGNORING CND OFFICIALS' PLEAS TO STAY ON THE MAIN ROAD, 1,000 OF SOME 15,000 MARCHERS LEFT THE PROCESSION AND POURED DOWN THE COUNTRY LANE MARKED ON THE " PEACE " SPIES' MAP . AFTER A SCUFFLE WITH POLICE, THE SHOUTING DEMONSTRATORS STAGED A MASS SQUAT AROUND THE BUNKER FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR, UNTIL ONE OF THEIR LEADERS ANNOUNCED : " WE HAVE ACHIEVED OUR OBJECT . " WHATEVER THEIR REAL OBJECT, THE " SPIES FOR PEACE " TRIGGERED A FULL-SCALE SCOTLAND YARD INVESTIGATION AND BROUGHT PRIME MINISTER HAROLD MACMILLAN SCURRYING BACK FROM HIS COUNTRY HOME TO LONDON FOR CNULTATION WITH HIS CABINET . NEVERTHELESS, CNN JOHN COLLINS, CND CHAIRMAN AND PRECEPTOR OF ST . PAUL'S CATHEDRAL, SIMPERED ON TV THAT MOST MARCHERS " TREATED IT RATHER AS A JOKE . " HIS MERRIMENT WAS NOT SHARED BY JAMES CAMERON, A CRUSADING JOURNALIST WHO HAS BEEN A PROMINENT FIGURE IN CND . SINCE ITS INCEPTION . CAMERON CNEDED SADLY THAT THE BAN-THE-BOMB MARCHES HAD BECOME A VEHICLE FOR TOO MANY SECNARY AND DUBIOUS INTENTIONS . " ADMITTING BELATEDLY THAT CND HAD BEEN TAKEN FOR A RIDE, CAMERON CRIED : " GOD SAVE US FROM OUR FRIENDS . </p>
