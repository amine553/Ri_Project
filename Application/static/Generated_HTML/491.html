        <p>RED CHINA WHO NEEDS PANTS ? PEKING LAST WEEK PUBLICLY ADMITTED THAT RED CHINA WILL NOT HAVE ITS LONGPROMISED NUCLEAR BOMB FOR A LONG TIME TO COME . FOREIGN MINISTER MARSHAL CHEN YI CONCEDED THAT ECONOMIC TROUBLES AND THE QUARREL WITH THE RUSSIANS (WHO WITHDREW THEIR TECHNICIANS AND BROKE AN ATOMIC-AID TREATY) HAVE SERIOUSLY DELAYED PEKING'S ATOMIC PROGRAM . IT WOULD BE " SEVERAL YEARS, " CHEN TOLD VISITING JAPANESE CORRESPONDENTS, BEFORE THE REGIME COULD EVEN TEST A CRUDE ATOM BOMB . BUT CHINA IS FAR FROM GIVING UP ITS NUCLEAR AMBITIONS . SOME TIME AGO, KHRUSHCHEV WARNED THAT ANY COUNTRY TRYING TO BUILD A BOMB WITHOUT ADEQUATE RESOURCES MIGHT LOSE ITS PANTS . NEVERTHELESS, SAID CHEN, SOUNDING LIKE AN ECHO OF CHARLES DE GAULLE, " AT THE RISK OF LOSING OUR PANTS, WE ARE DETERMINED TO GO AHEAD AND BUILD OUR OWN ATOMIC BOMBS . OTHERWISE WE WILL END UP AS A SECOND- OR THIRD-CLASS NATION . </p>
