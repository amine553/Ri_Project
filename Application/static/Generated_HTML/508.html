FROM BEVERLY HILLS SHE FLEW TO ROME TO JOIN HER THREE YOUNGER CHILDREN, SON TRAC, 15, SON QUYHN, 11, AND DAUGHTER LE QUYEN, 4 . EITHER BECAUSE OF A SHORTAGE OF FUNDS OR A MISUNDERSTANDING WITH CALIFORNIA'S YOUNG REPUBLICANS, WHO HAD ORIGINALLY INVITED HER TO LOS ANGELES TO SPEAK, MME . NHU DEPARTED OWING NEARLY HALF OF HER $2,000 BILL AT THE BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL (THE MANAGER DID NOT SEEM WORRIED ABOUT COLLECTING) . FOLLOWING HER BY MAIL WAS A STACK OF BOOKS, AMONG THEM TO LIVE AGAIN AND TNT : THE POWER WITHIN YOU ; HOW TO RELEASE THE FORCES INSIDE YOU AND GET WHAT YOU WANT . AT THE AIRPORT, READING A LONG FAREWELL STATEMENT, SHE REFERRED TO THE FACT THAT THE US  HAD ENCOURAGED THE COUP : " JUDAS HAS SOLD THE CHRIST FOR 30 PIECES OF SILVER . THE NGO BROTHERS HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR A FEW DOLLARS . " BY THIS MME . NHU MEANT THE AID THAT THE US  HAD WITHHELD FROM DIEM BUT RESTORED " TO THOSE WHO WOULD NOT HESITATE TO TURN THEIR GUNS AGAINST THEIR OWN DULY ELECTED LEADERS . " SHE HAD HEARD REPORTS THAT, AFTER BEING MURDERED BY SOUTH VIET NAM'S NEW RULERS, " PRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM'S FACE WAS SERENE IN DEATH, AND MY HUSBAND HAD A SLIGHT SMILE THOUGH HIS FACE WAS ALL STREAKED WITH BLOOD . I THINK THEREFORE THAT I CANNOT BE LESS SERENE THAN THEY . " IN ROME SHE WAS WELCOMED BY DIEM'S BROTHER, ARCHBISHOP NGO DINH THUC, WHO HAD BEEN ATTENDING THE VATICAN COUNCIL ; THEN SHE WAS WHISKED TO A TREESHADED CONVENT FOR A REST . EVENTUALLY, MME . NHU INSISTS, SHE WILL RETURN TO SOUTH VIET NAM . SAID SHE : " MY BURDEN WILL BE HARD INDEED, FOR THE DEVIL HAS NOT BEEN DISARMED AND IS STILL TRYING TO BEAT ME DOWN .  </p>
