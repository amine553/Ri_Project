        <p>EAST GERMANY THE HARDER THEY FALL EAST GERMAN COMMUNISTS FOREVER ACCUSE WEST GERMAN CHANCELLOR KONRAD ADENAUER OF HARBORING FORMER NAZIS IN HIS GOVERNMENT, BUT LAST WEEK, TO THEIR ACUTE EMBARRASSMENT, A PROMINENT EXNAZI TURNED UP RIGHT AMONG EAST GERMANY'S TOP TWELVE COMMUNISTS . THE MAN WAS PROFESSOR DR . KARL-HEINZ BARTSCH, 39, A BRILLIANT AGRICULTURALIST WHO IN SCARCELY MORE THAN A DECADE SOARED FROM COMPLETE OBSCURITY TO A SPOT IN WALTER ULBRICHT'S CABINET . FIRST GAINING PROMINENCE WITH HIS LECTURES ON ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AT EAST BERLIN'S HUMBOLDT UNIVERSITY, BARTSCH WAS GIVEN A JOB CONTROLLING COLLECTIVE FARMS, SOON WAS MADE DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE . PERHAPS HE DID NOT TELL HIS COLLEAGUES OF SOME OF HIS EARLIER ACHIEVEMENTS : A PLACE IN THE HITLERJUGEND AT NINE, HITLER'S CROSS OF DANZIG AT 16 (PRESUMABLY FOR DEEDS IN POLAND), A WAR CAREER IN THE NOTORIOUS SS . WESTERN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES KNEW ALL ABOUT BARTSCH, HOWEVER . HIS NAME HAD TURNED UP IN THE BERLIN DOCUMENTS CENTER, AN ARCHIVE OF OLD NAZI MEMBERSHIP FILES RESCUED FROM THE STORAGE HEAP OF A WEST GERMAN PAPERMILL AFTER THE WAR . RESISTING THE TEMPTATION TO SPILL THE FACTS ON BARTSCH, INTELLIGENCE BIDED ITS TIME . FORTNIGHT AGO, THE RISING HERR BARTSCH BECAME AGRICULTURAL CZAR, AND AT THIS POINT OUT TO WEST BERLIN NEWSPAPERS WENT FULL DOSSIERS ON THE NEW COMMUNIST CABINET MINISTER . FOR TWO DAYS THE EAST GERMAN GOVERNMENT IGNORED THE HEADLINES . THEN ULBRICHT'S PARTY CONTROL COMMITTEE MET AND DECIDED THAT BARTSCH, FOR CAUSING " SERIOUS DAMAGE " TO THE PARTY, WOULD BE DISMISSED FROM ALL HIS PARTY AND GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS . HE HAD BEEN IN OFFICE JUST 36 HOURS . </p>
